## Tips for you

- In this example I use EJS, thats stands for Embedded JavaScript. It's a simple templating language that allows you to generate HTML dynamically using JavaScript. EJS files typically have a .ejs extension.

## Start project

- mkdir car-management-system
- cd car-management-system
- npm init -y
- npm install express body-parser ejs
- node index.js
- <http://localhost:3000>
