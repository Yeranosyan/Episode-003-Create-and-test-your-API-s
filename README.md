# ðŸŽ¬ Episode 003: Creating and Testing CRUD Operations with Node.js and Express

Hello! Thanks for watching Episode 003!

In this episode, we'll learn how to create, test, and perform CRUD operations using Node.js and the Express framework. We'll also explore how to test our API calls using tools like Postman.

## Tips for you

- In this example I use EJS, thats stands for Embedded JavaScript. It's a simple templating language that allows you to generate HTML dynamically using JavaScript. EJS files typically have a .ejs extension.

## Start project

- mkdir car-management-system
- cd car-management-system
- npm init -y
- npm install express body-parser ejs
- node index.js
- <http://localhost:3000>
